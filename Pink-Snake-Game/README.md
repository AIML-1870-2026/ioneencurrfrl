## Game Philosophy: Emergent Behavior

This game demonstrates **emergent behavior** - complex, challenging gameplay arising from just three simple rules:

1. **Eat food → Grow longer**
2. **Don't hit yourself**
3. **Don't hit walls**

As you succeed (eat food), you create your own challenge (longer tail, less space). This self-creating difficulty is what makes Snake timeless!
